1. What is a Library in your own words?
a library is a collection of pre-written code—typically organized in modules—that developers can reuse to perform common tasks without reinventing the wheel.
2. What command do we use to start using a library in our Python file?
You use the import statement. For instance, to use Python’s math library, you write:
3. List at least 3 built-in Python libraries?

What is a module in your own words?
in Python is simply a file (ending in .py) that contains Python code—like functions, classes, and variables—which you can import into other Python scripts.
5. State why libraries and modules are helpful in your own words.
By grouping related functionality into separate files (modules), your code becomes cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to navigate.
